    "**How is the anom function defined?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The anom function is a member function, available to instances of the Line_Segment structure. Let us call such an instance *one*. The anom function takes another separate instance of the Line_Segment structure as an argument. This instance is defined as *other* within the function definition above. The output of the function is a real number. Therefore we can think of anon as being a function of two line segments (*one* and *other*) which returns a real number. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What does the anom function do with the two line segments *one* and *other*?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the anom function characterises each original line segment (*one* and *other*) with a new point in the x-y plane. New line segments which are formed by the origin and these new points are effectively the same as the original line segments but transformed so that they start at the origin but have the same magnitude and direction as the original line segments. By transforming both the line segments *one* and *other*, this step has effectively normalised the line segments so they both start at the origin. This normalisation has implicitly interpretted the line segments as vectors with a direction, assuming that they begin at their first defined point and end at their second. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the anom function returns a cross product of the two new points which characterise the line segments. Geometrically speaking, this can be thought of as calculating the area of the parallelogram which is created using each normalised line segment as a side of the parallelogram. \n",
    "\n",
    "**An example**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagrams illustrate these two steps using an example with the following two lines: \n",
    "\n",
    "* line 1 starts at $a$ and finishes at $b$ where the x- and y-coordinates of $a$ and $b$ are $(2,1)$ and $(8,3)$ respectively. \n",
    "* line 2 starts at $c$ and finishes at $d$ where the x- and y-coordinates of $c$ and $d$ are $(6,6)$ and $(7,9)$ respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first diagram shows lines 1 and 2 in blue and red respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "![lineplot1](lineplot1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next diagram shows how the first part of the function characterises the first line with a point $e$, the second line with a point $f$, and that these two points, together with the origin, normalise the two original line segments so they start at the origin, but maintain their length and direction. The normalised line segments are drawn with dashed lines in the diagram below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![lineplot2](lineplot2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step of the alorigthm is to calculate the cross product of the two points $e$ and $f$. As the diagram below illustrates, this is equivalent to calculating the area (shaded) of the parallelogram created using the normalised line segments as sides of the parallelogram. An auxiliary point $aux$ is used at coordinates $(7,5)$ to complete the parallelogram. \n",
    "\n",
    "![lineplot3](lineplot3.png)\n",

    "The area of the shaded region is equal to the cross product of $e$ and $f$. $Area = e_x f_y - e_y f_x = 18-2 = 16$. "

    "## Part 3: Jarvis March implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this part implements the Jarvis march algorithm in C++. The algorithm is almost identical to the algorithm which I provided in Python in January. The only change is: \n",
    "\n",
    "* the code no longer computes the angle between two line segments which start at the origin of the two-dimensional plane, instead it simply computes the cross product and dot product of the two points corresponding to the end of those two line segments. This is a slightly simpler way of determining the orientation of the two line segments. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some minor changes to the code, as detailed below: \n",
    "\n",
    "* there is no longer a *line* class since this was used to create instances of line segments starting at the origin and ending at another point. The information can more simply be captured with points (from the point class) corresponding to the end of those line segments. \n",
    "* there is no longer a *set_of_points* class. I have instead simply collected points into a C++ vector. This was becasue (a) the C++ vector provides what I need and there was no vector data structure in Python and (b) I built my *set_of_points* in Python by inheriting from the *tuple* class and I have not yet studied inheritance in C++ structures, which i felt was not really necessary for this task. \n",
    "* Due to the previous point, the functions *find_leftmost_point*, *find_new_point* and *find_convex_hull* are now functions in their own right, rather than member functions of the *set_of_points* class. \n",
    "\n",

    "The next question is - can we improve the brute force algorithm in terms of best-case computational complexity? The answer is yes, we can. To show this, we draw upon the fact that the two points in a set $\\mathcal{Q}$ which are furthest apart must lie on the convex hull of $\\mathcal{Q}$. Let us call these two points $a$ and $b$ and the distance between them $x$. Let us first assume that point $a$ is on the convex hull. If point $b$ was *not* on the convex hull, then there would be another point $c$, on the convex hull, with a distance from $a$ of $y$ with $y > x$. But if $y > x$ then $a$ and $b$ are not the points furthest apart in the set, and this does not make sense. It therefore cannot be true that either $a$ or $b$ are not on the convex hull if they are the furthest apart in the set $\\mathcal{Q}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, an algorithm with better best-case computational complexity than the brute force algorithm would first identify points on the convex hull, and then apply the brute force algorithm only to those points on that convex hull. I will call this algorithm the improved algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "If $N >> H$ where $H$ is the number of points on the hull, then this is clearly better than our brute force algorithm. Finding the convex hull (using my algorithm from assignment 1) is $O(NH)$, and finding the furthest points on that hull is $O(H^2)$ so the combination is $O(NH)$ since this is the dominant term. This is better than $O(N^2)$ from the brute force algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the worst case in my improved algorithm is worse than the brute-force algorithm. If all the points are on the convex hull, i.e. if $N == H$, then the second part of my improved algorithm is identical to the original brute force algorithm, but the improved algorithm adds an initial step of finding the convex hull, which clearly adds more computational time. \n",
